Lyric app
Choose a song, change the lyrics that rhyme with another word with word API 


## *User Story*

As a user, I want to get the lyrics to my favourite song, so that I can change the words I donâ€™t like, and copy to clipboard to save somewhere else
- Will be using lyrics.ovh API for a lyric database
- Will be using words API for rhymes, synonyms and antonyms
- Make it into a game by toggling the highlight of what words were changed and what the origional word was with the changed word
- As an option, we may add spotify API to listen to a sample of the song
